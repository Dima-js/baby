            The ideal chocolate was born in <span>2016</span>, in the French town of Grenoble. Its creation is the result of one of the most unusual teams ever assembled in the world of confectionery. A French chocolatier, Japanese dietologists and an experienced confectioner (Olesya Solomina, founder of Lacma) created the technology that made it possible something much more impressive than just healthy, natural sweets. Due to its low temperature processing, this nutritious product has a full range of probiotic qualities, without compromising flavor. The LaciLact technology has already been patented in Ukraine and is acquiring a patent in Switzerland.
